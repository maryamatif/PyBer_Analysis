# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this exercise was to analyze ride-sharing data in three city types (Rural, Urban, Suburban). We were given information about the number of drivers in each city, number of rides taken and the fare per ride. Using jupyter interface, we were able to work on the data in a time efficient manner and draw important insights from the results provided.
## Results
Synthesizing the fare data by city type gave us the following insights:
1. Urban ride sharing is the most expensive as the average fare paid in the Urban area was the highest, followed by suburban and then rural area.
2. Urban area experienced the most rides (1,625), followed by suburban (625) and then rural (125). This makes sense considering Urban area is the most busiest and crowded hence there are more people traveling from one place to another.
3. Average fare per ride was $34.62 in the Urban area and only $24.53 in the rural area. More demand of rides in the urban area pushed the fare price upwards. 
4. Average fare per driver is the highest in the rural area ($55.49) and lowest in the Urban area ($16.57). This also aligns with our expectation as urban area is saturated in terms of total drivers present (2,405) and so the average fare per driver is low. Rural area has much less drivers (78) and so the fare per driver there is much higher.
## Recommendation
1. Raise the fares in the Urban area so that the average fare per driver is the same in Urban Rural and Suburban areas.
2. Limit the number of drivers in the Urban area so the income per driver can potentially improve. 
3. Raise the fare prices during busy seasons to generate more income in all three city types.
4. Encourage more people to become drivers in the rural area by offering non financial incentives (insurance etc.) to make the average fare more equal among the city types.
